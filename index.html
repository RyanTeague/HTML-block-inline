    <!--HTML Block and Line Elements
    
        Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what
        type of element it is.

        The two most common display values are block and inline
    -->

    <!--block-level Elements
    
        A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers
        automatically add some space (a margin) before and afffter the element.

        A block-level element always takes up the up the full width avaliable (stretches out
        to the left and right as far as it can).

        Two commonly used block element are: <p> and <div>.
        
        The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
        
            The <p> element is a block-level element.
            
            The <div> element is a block-level element.
    -->

    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
